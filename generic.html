                    <h2>Early Fascination with Technology</h2>
                    <p>
                        From a young age, my fascination with technology has been a driving force in my life. I vividly remember when I was just five years old and my father bought me a Nintendo Wii. I was amazed by how such a compact device could deliver an immersive gaming experience. This early encounter sparked my curiosity and love for technology, laying the foundation for my future career aspirations.
